The following repository contains my homework assignments for the [CS229: Machine Learning course from Stanford](http://cs229.stanford.edu/)

Because I am not student at Stanford University, it is hard to access the data files necessary for the coding questions.

I am currently completing assignments 1, 2, 3 and 4 from the Fall 2017 course for which I managed to find data files at https://github.com/ccombier/stanford-CS229 . 

**By turning in this assignment, I agree by the Stanford honor code and declare that all
of this is my own work.**
